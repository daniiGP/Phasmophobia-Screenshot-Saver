# Phasmobobia Screenshot Saver  
  
This is a mod that send all phasmophobia photos to a discord webhook. 
  

# IMPORTANT

This only works using the [PhasBypass](https://github.com/daniiGP/PhasBypass), if phasmophobia close when loading splash screen, probably bypass is out date, you can only wait for updates.


# Installation
